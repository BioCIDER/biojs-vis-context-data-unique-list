		<p class="context_description_container">Implementation of # cancer genomics into the clinic is becoming a reality. Personalised medicine or "Precision medicine" as some authors refer to it, uses molecular data from a specific patient to guide clinical decisions such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment. This will revolutionise healthcare and will play a dominant role in the future of cancer therapy. Bioinformatics analyses are essential to identify patients who will benefit from treatment based on their molecular profile, and to tailor chemotherapeutic regimens accordingly. The aim of this course is to present a complete computational pipeline for the analysis and interpretation of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, such as exome sequencing or targeted panels that are commonly used in the clinic.</p>
